                <p class="p1">The red panda is a small, adorable animal that lives mainly in the mountains of Nepal, India, Bhutan, and China. It has reddish-brown fur, a long, bushy tail, and a cute face with white markings. Red pandas are mostly active at night and eat mainly bamboo, but they also enjoy fruits, berries, and small insects. They are excellent climbers and spend a lot of time in trees. Unfortunately, red pandas are endangered because their natural habitat is shrinking due to deforestation. People all over the world are working to protect them and their homes. Seeing a red panda is always amazing because of its playful and gentle nature.</p>
